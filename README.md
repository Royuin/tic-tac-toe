# tic-tac-toe

## A Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows users to pick their names and play a match.

This project was made to learn from The Odin Project curriculum. Basic functionality was told on what the project was supposed to be able to do. From there however no follow along video or code was provided the code was made from scratch.

One of the main goals with this project was to put as much code as possible in a module or factory function. The reason for this was to apply the knowledge learned about taking items out global scope.
